# LMMCMC
MCMC for Gaussian Linear Models

Install was clean on Apple silicon. 
I do not foresee issues on other architecture.
Install does not clean the .o or .so files from the local directory from which the install is performed.
You can do that clean up yourself. See the R literature for instructions?
